# Matrix Multiplication Program

This Python program performs matrix multiplication. It allows users to input two matrices and calculates their product. The program includes the following functionalities:

- **Input Matrices**: Users can enter the dimensions and elements of two matrices.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: The program checks if the matrices can be multiplied (the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix) and performs the multiplication.
- **Display Result**: The resulting matrix is displayed in a readable format.

## Functions:
- `input_matrix(rows, cols)`: Prompts the user to input a matrix of specified dimensions.
- `multiply_matrices(matrix_a, matrix_b)`: Multiplies two matrices and returns the resulting matrix.
- `display_matrix(matrix)`: Displays a matrix in a formatted manner.

## Usage:
Run the program, input the dimensions and elements of the two matrices, and the program will output the result of their multiplication.
